Hi this is Yan Sun, aka Simon

If you want to test this, do the following
  1. Install the apk in your emulator.
  I personally use the following steps
    1. go to android sdk
    2. go to platform-tools
    3. run adb to install the apk after you fire up an emulator 
        (./adb install <path to your apk, usually under app/release of your project>)
    4. voila 
  2. Email any test google play account to "simon.yansun@gmail.com" and explain your purpose
  Thank you
