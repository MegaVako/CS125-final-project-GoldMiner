Hi this is Yan Sun, aka Simon

If you want to test this, do the following
  1. Install the apk in your emulator
    I personally use the following steps
      go to android sdk
      go to platform-tools
      run adb to install the apk after you fire up an emulator 
        (./adb install <path to your apk, usually under app/release of your project>)
       voila 
  2. Email any test google play account to "simon.yansun@gmail.com" and explain your purpose
  Thank you
